# mybranch.dev

My personal [blog](https://blog.mybranch.dev), managed with `hugo`. It's basically an `nginx` image hosted on Google Cloud Run, which contains the generated site. Google Cloud Build is used to build and deploy.

More information about the setup is detailed on here: [Hello, Goodbye (Medium)](https://mybranch.dev/posts/hello/)
