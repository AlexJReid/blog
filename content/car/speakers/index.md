My 996 has the middle of the range "hi-fi" package consisting of the MDR32 mini disc head unit (made by Becker) and six Nokia speakers powered by a small Nokia amp in the frunk.

A Porsche CDC 3 changer was also added later by a previous owner which works perfectly, after I had found some CDs. No luck in finding my minidisc mix tapes from 2001. As it isn't a Bose system there's no weird DSP units or optical connections, as far as I know. This makes upgrading it cheaply a little easier.

I am glad that my car has the more basic audio as the contemporary _cutting edge_ from 1998 has aged very poorly. PacMan style satnav with large CD-ROM drives would be impossible to live with. A basic orange matrix display that shows `Radio 2` most of the time has aged far better.

The front dash speakers needed to go as the tweeters were blown. I followed [this guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIC-mP1hH50) which is basically a hack job. Destroy the disintegrated front speakers but salvage the connectors and mounts. You can then mount some [new Alpine speakers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alpine-SPG-10C2-10cm-2-Way-Speakers/dp/B002XCNPMS/ref=asc_df_B002XCNPMS/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310873119586&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1216362323464065415&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046774&hvtargid=pla-562971012200&psc=1) within.

Very easy if you're happy to take a saw to some brand new speakers. They were less than Â£50 so I was not expecting much, but this was a huge improvement and great value for money. I only did the fronts but may do the backs later.

The lower door speakers provide most of the bass. These are still crap Nokia units that are well past their best, but good enough for now.
