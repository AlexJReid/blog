title = "Porsche 996"

> After years of running a mixture of boring, terrible and very good new cars, I decided to buy what might be my last analogue, manual car - a 1998 Porsche 911 (996) Carerra 2. It is an early throttle cable/no sunroof/M030/ambers car, built on the same production line as the outgoing 993. Despite being registered as **PHZ 443**, my daughter has named it **Grampy** as it is "grey, old and a bit smelly."

Below is a journal of my ownership journey to date. I also post too many photos of it over on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/alexjreid).
