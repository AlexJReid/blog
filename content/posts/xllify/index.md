**Excel is the original rapid application development tool.** Developers can do unholy things to get a job done without code. Long term, these solutions can end up brittle and hard to extend.

Over the years there have been many approaches for extending Excel beyond formula soup and VBA. There is the excellent [Excel-DNA](https://excel-dna.net/), [PyXLL](https://www.pyxll.com/), Microsoft's own [Office.js](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/overview/excel-add-ins-reference-overview) and [Python](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/introduction-to-python-in-excel-55643c2e-ff56-4168-b1ce-9428c8308545) support, among others. These technologies are far simpler and feature rich than the [Excel C Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/excel/welcome-to-the-excel-software-development-kit) and are well documented and supported.

There are many ways to skin a cat, so it is wise to **check them out first to see which one fits a problem space best.**

### C, C, C don't prove them right ðŸŽµ

An XLL is a DLL that exports functions enabling its code to be loaded, unsafely, into Excel. A degree in technical archeology is recommended, or failing that an appreciation of all things 1990s. Pop some Nirvana (or Spice Girls) onto your MiniDisc player and delve in. The C API brings with it exciting features such as dumping garbage into cells, crashing Excel and generally causing chaos. When used directly, one must exercise plenty of caution.

Lack of safety and ancient history complaints aside, **we cannot escape the fact that in certain scenarios, the C API still takes the crown for absolute efficiency and performance.** JavaScript interop performance (not the language itself) can be poor, and Microsoft's own Python support involves a network call: enough said. Excel-DNA performance is great, but requires .NET installing (probably a non issue if 2.0 is targetted), C# development chops and Visual Studio for Windows.

What if there was an easy way of leveraging the speed of the C API, [safely exposed](https://luau.org/sandbox) through a fast, yet simple scripting language, with no dependency hell or complicated development setup?

### Hello, xllify

**xllify is an API that takes your Lua functions and emits a signed, ready to go XLL to load into Excel.** Developers download a simple interpreter for their Mac, Linux and Windows (or CI environment) to develop and test their functions locally, ahead of submitting them to be converted into an XLL.

A trivial example would be:

```lua
xllify.ExcelFunction(
    {
        name = "acme.ADD",
        description = "Adds two numbers",
        category = "Math",
    },
    function(a: number, b: number): number
        return a + b
    end
)

xllify.ExcelFunction(
    {
        name = "acme.RANDO",
        description = "Gives you a random number, you rando",
        category = "Math",
        volatile = true,
    },
    function(): number
        return math.random()
    end
)
```

This exposes `acme.ADD` and `acme.RANDO` to Excel, complete with inline documentation.

Users can call them as they would any Excel function: `=acme.ADD(3,2)`. `acme.RANDO` is volatile so will rerun on every calculation. Parameters are inferred from the function signature.

Developers can test their Lua implemented functions on any platform. No Windows machine, IDE, Office installation or anything like that is required - just the `xllify` CLI to run and validate their work locally. This is effectively a Lua interpreter preloaded with some libraries.

xllify embeds the Roblox implementation of Lua called [Luau](https://luau.org/library). It is compatible with Lua 5.1.

Luau was used for sandboxing reasons. Potentially harmful Lua code cannot be run. It also has a gradual typing system to provide useful type hints to the conversion process, and also help developers catch bugs early on.

As part of a build, developers offer up their Lua code to xllify through the provided GitHub Action.

```yaml
jobs:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    xllify:
      - name: Build Excel add-in with xllify
        uses: acornsoftuk/xllify@v1
        with:
          XLLIFY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.XLLIFY_SECRET }}
          BUILD_ASSEMBLY_NAME: acme_addin.xll
          TARGET: Release-x64
          LUA:
            - acme.luau
```

The developer's build is using an Ubuntu runner. The Lua code is compiled into bytecode using this runner. Any errors will be reported should this fail.

If the bytecode compilation succeeds, it is then submitted to the xllify API which will remotely build and sign the XLL on Windows with the necessary MSVC toolchain. The developer does not incur Windows runner costs. The action will download the built assembly within about 10-15 seconds.

From there, the developer can add further steps in their action to publish or deploy the resulting XLL.

### Why this is good

Developer quality of life almost always trumps raw performance. There is a certain irony in extolling the virtues of the speed of C and then diminishing that coupling it to a scripting language. However, initial tests show that a careful and efficient stitching together of the two worlds can yield a happy balance between performance, safety and productivity.

     content: "";
     display: table;
     clear: both;
 }
</style>

### How does it work?

Not much to see here. An XLL build is orchestrated with CMake; Luau and XLCALL32 are linked to form an XLL. There's standard C++ glue to expose relevant aspects of the Excel SDK and marshal between `LPXLOPER12` and friends, carefully managing memory and abstracting quirks - wide Pascal strings and other such fun. The Lua code is introinspected and C++ wrappers generated so that the functions are indirectly exported within the XLL.

The submitted Luau bytecode is packed into the assembly as a resource, which is loaded into the Lua environment when the add-in is loaded. _Customer_ builds run on segregated GitHub Actions Windows runners.

Customer code is somewhat obsfucated through its compilation to bytecode, but a self-run solution to this is in the works, should code privacy be a concern.
